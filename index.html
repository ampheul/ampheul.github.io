    <h1>Welcome to Thomas Vandeven's Website.</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Thomas Vandeven.
      I am a lover of Math and Computer science.
      Recently I have been learning about category theory, linear logic, and type systems.
      I develop open source projects on Github.
      I was the organizer for the LFP meetup in London Ontario in 2020.
      I graduated from Western University with an Honors specialization in Mathematics and a Major in Computer Science in Fall 2019.

    <p>I have created this page recently. Please come back in a couple of weeks when I have more filled in!</p>
